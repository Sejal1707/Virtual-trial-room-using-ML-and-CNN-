We usually face a problem such as whether this colour, fit or the design pattern of any particular garment will look good on me or not. To solve this problem we came up with a unique project idea about virtual trial room which ensures us to choose garments which look good or not. Basically human joint points are first recognised and then according to that the particular garment which we have choosen is superimposed on our body virtually. This helps in choosing right colour, fit and pattern for us by making easy shopping
